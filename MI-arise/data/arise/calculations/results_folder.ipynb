ARISE can treat more than 100 crystal structures, including one-, two-dimensional, and bulk materials - in robust and threshold-independent fashion. The Bayesian-deep-learning model yields not only a classification but also uncertainty estimates, which are principled (i.e., they approximate the uncertainty estimates of a Gaussian process) [2,3]. These uncertainty estimates correlate with crystal order.\n",

In dropout, individual neurons are randomly dropped in each layer, usually only during training to avoid over-specialization of individual units and this way control overfitting. One can show that  employing dropout also at test time yields a probabilistic model whose uncertainty estimates approximate those of a Gaussian process. In particular, neural-network optimization with dropout is equivalent to performing variational inference (see [3] for more details, especially sections 1, 2, and 3.3). \n",

In contrast, standard neural networks are deterministic and thus all predictions are identical. Sampling the output layer of the Bayesian neural network actually corresponds to sampling from (an approximated version of) the true probability distribution of outputs. Deterministic networks only provide a point estimate of this distribution, leading to overconfident predictions (see section 1.5 of [3]). Averaging the forward-passes gives an average classification probability vector, and the predicted class label can be inferred by selecting the most likely class (i.e., computing the argmax). Additional statistical information  is contained in the classification probability samples.  In [1], we employ mutual information (as implemented in *ai4materials*) to obtain a single uncertainty-quantifying number from the output samples. \n",

    "One important aspect of [1] is the application of unsupervised learning techniques to analyze the internal neural network representations. This allows to *explain* the trained model by showing that regularities in the neural-network representation space correspond to physical characteristics. Using this strategy, one can conduct exploratory analysis, with the goal to discover patterns in high-dimensional representation space and to relate them to the crystal structure -  leading to the discovery of defective regions (e.g., grain boundaries or regions that are distorted in similar/distinct  fashion, cf. Fig. 2 and 4 of [1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we apply clustering (HDBSCAN https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html) to identify groups in the high-dimensional neural-network representations. Furthermore the manifold-learning method UMAP (https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is employed to obtain a low-dimensional embedding (here 2D) that can be interpreted by human eye. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important parameters for the unsupervised techniques employed in this work are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HDBSCAN: min_cluster_size (int) - determines the minimum number of points a cluster must contain. In more detail, HDBSCAN employs (agglomerative) hierarchical clustering (https://www.displayr.com/what-is-hierarchical-clustering/) to construct a hierarchical cluster tree, where only those clusters are considered that contain as many data points as defined via min_cluster_size. Cluster assignments are extracted by computing a cluster stability value and the most stable clusters are used to construct a final, so-called flat clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* UMAP: n_neighbors (int) - determines the trade-off between capturing local (small n_neighbors) vs global (large n_neighbors) relationships in the data. Specifically, UMAP constructs a topological representation of the data (in practice corresponding to a specific type of k-neighbor graph), while some assumptions are made (e.g., the data being uniformly distributed on a Riemannian manifold). Then a low-dimensional representation is found by matching its topological representation with the one of the original data (where the matching procedure amounts to the definition of a cross-entropy loss function and the application of stochastic gradient descent). The parameter n_neighbors influences the high-dimensional topological representation. The distances in the low-dimensional representation can also be tuned via 'min_dist', while this parameter is typically considered more as only tuning the visualization / the distances in the low-dimensional embedding - see also https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/ for a discussion with hands-on examples."

    "***Remark:*** For the HDBSCAN clustering, there are two options: Either you can choose the 'cluster_labels', which is the cluster assignment that arises from the standard (flat) clustering procedure, or the 'argmax_clustering' color scale, which is determined from the soft-clustering feature of HDBSCAN. Specifically, HDBSCAN allows to calculate a vector for each point, with component i capturing the \"probability\" that the point is a member of cluster i. Then, we can infer a cluster assignment for points that would normally be considered outliers by taking the cluster whose membership probability is maximal (while we consider the point an outlier if none of its cluster probabilities exceeds a certain threshold - here, we choose 10 %). This procedure allows to obtain reasonable clusterings also in the presence of higher levels of noise (as encountered in atomic electron tomography data[9-12], which is analyzed using ARISE in Fig. 4 of [1]). Here, it will not make a qualitative difference in performance, i.e., the basic structure of the polycrystal (four grains + grain boundaries) can be recovered by both clustering procedures."
